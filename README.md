SAS macro to calculate the 2022 race neutral GLI percent predicted values for PFT data. The 2012 macro was updated with the new equations from 2022. 
User only needs the "GLI_macro_code_2025_02_11.sas" and the "verticle_lookup_table2_2022.sas7bdat" files and they function the same as the 2012 macros (i.e., the process and coding of variables is similar).

The other two files are provided for informational purposes and are needed to for the calculations. 
1. "gli_global_lookuptables_dec6.xls" is the file provided as supplemental material from the 2022 paper
2. "GLI 2022 create new lookup table.sas" is the code used to modify the supplemental table so that it is formatted the same as the 2012 version of the lookup table and so that it can be used with the SAS macro
